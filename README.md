### Project instructions
#### Visuals
- The application should display two cats. Each cat includes:
	- the cat's name
	- a picture of the cat
	- text showing the number of clicks
- The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

#### Interaction
- The number of clicks should increment when each cat picture is clicked.
